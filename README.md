This is a very simple extension for Google Chrome. This is an extensive blocklist made by students in collaboration with K12 sysadmins in order to effectively block contraband websites.
 
This extension is released for free in and can be installed directly from the Chrome store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blacklist/jbpccandodannohfaoncogijbkfcmpgo?hl=en&gl=US.
Alternatively, to install this extension directly from the source, download the code from GitHub, extract it, and then add it to Chrome as detailed in step 4 of Create and Load Extensions on this page: http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html.
 
Please note that as a district enforced extension, students will not be able to remove it.
